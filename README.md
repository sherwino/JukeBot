# JukeBot for Firefox

A Firfox alternative to [@austinhaydon's JukeBot](https://github.com/austinhaydon/JukeBot).
The main objective of this extension is to provide additional functionality to http://jqbx.fm/.

This plugin should help you get notifications, and help you upvote songs when you are in another tab.
